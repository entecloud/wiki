title: Renaming a root crypt mapper name
---

When we do a FDE with LUKS, the installers won't give us an option to choose our own mapper name. At least that I know of. Debian has a `_crypt` suffix at the end of the partition name, and rest have their own defaults. But I hate that autogenerated name. 

How do I change that? It's dead simple!

## Modify crypttab

```bash
sudo nano /etc/crypttab
```
You will see an entry that corresponds to your current mapper name. Replace that with your own.

```config
<your_name_here> UUID=<UUID> none luks,discard,x-initrd.attach
```

## Modify fstab

Open `/etc/fstab` and modify the existing mapper name with new one

## Rename current mapper

```bash
sudo dmsetup rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

## Rebuild initramfs (or dracut)  

```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u 
sudo update-grub # Not needed, but just in case :)  

sudo reboot
```
