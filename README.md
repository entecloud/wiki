# Ente Cloud Wiki

Just wanted to keep notes of items I learned.

## Getting Started

This repo is built with Hugo, with the PaperMod theme. So make sure you've Hugo installed.

Alternatively, I've configured a dev containers in this repo, which will have all the tools you'd need.

The PaperMod theme is installed as git submodule. So when cloning this repo, make sure you also clone the submodules as well.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/entecloud/wiki
```

And run,

```bash
hugo server
```
